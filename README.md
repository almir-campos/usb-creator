USB Creator
===================

Please, help translating: https://www.transifex.com/solydxk/usb-creator/dashboard/

Create a bootable USB pen drive with multiple ISO images.

I've been trying out various distributions and creating menus in /boot/grub/grub.cfg especially for them.

These I've done successfully:

    * SolydX and SolydK
    * Ubuntu (and probably its derivates as well but obviously not tested those).
    * Debian Live.
    * Debian mini.
    * Regular Fedora.
    * Arch dual and Arch boot.
    * Mageia regular.
    * Manjaro.
    * Gentoo.
    * Slack.
    * Knoppix.
    * SysRescue.
    * CloneZilla.
    * Gparted.


Not tested:

    * Debian regular (not live or mini).
    * OpenSuse regular and live (I haven't got a pen drive big enough for the ISOs).
    * CentOS regular and live (I haven't got a pen drive big enough for the ISOs).
    * Antix.
    * PartedMagic


No worky:

    * Fedora live.
    * Mageia live.


I could use some help on those I couldn't test and those that I can't get working.
If you want to add or change anything. You can find all the relevant code at the top of /usr/bin/usb-creator.
