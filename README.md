USB Creator
===================

Please, help translating: https://www.transifex.com/solydxk/usb-creator/dashboard/

Create a bootable USB pen drive with multiple ISO images.

I've been trying out various distributions and creating menus in /boot/grub/grub.cfg especially for them.

These I've done successfully:

    * SolydX and SolydK
    * Ubuntu 32/64/mate/lubuntu (and probably the other derivates as well).
    * Debian Live.
    * Debian mini.
    * Arch dual and Arch boot.
    * Mageia regular.
    * Manjaro.
    * Gentoo.
    * Slack.
    * Knoppix.
    * Antix.
    * openSuse Live
    * SysRescue.
    * CloneZilla.
    * Puppy (had to add "puppy" to the iso name)
    * Kali
    * Lite
    * Zorin
    * PClinuxOS
    * Gparted
    * q4os
    * bodhi
    * chromixium
    * netrunner
    * netrunner rolling
    * tails
    * arch
    * 4mlinux
    * robolinux
    * ultimate edition
    * sparky linux


Not tested:

    * Debian regular (not live or mini).
    * OpenSuse regular and live (I haven't got a pen drive big enough for the ISOs).
    * PartedMagic


No worky:

    * Fedora workstation and live.
    * CentOS (ends in black screen).
    * Mageia live.
    * Simplicity (had to add "simplicity" to the iso name)
    * Lxle
    * SolusOS
    * sabayon
    * black lab
    * kaos
    * antergos
    * vector
    * mangaka
    * peppermint
    * wattos


I could use some help on those I couldn't test and those that I can't get working.
If you want to add or change anything. You can find all the relevant code at the top of /usr/bin/usb-creator.
