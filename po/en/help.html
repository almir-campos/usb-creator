	<h1>USB Creator Help</h1>
	<div class="main">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The USB Creator is a tool to help users to create a bootable flash drive with multiple Linux operating systems.</p>

		<h2>Important</h2>
		<p>Make sure you backed up all important data from the flash drive before you start.</p>

		<h2>Commands</h2>
		<p>You can also use the USB Creator from the terminal. Here are some examples:</p>

		<h3># usb-creator -f -i /path/to/my.iso -m</h3>
		<p>This will format the flash drive, copy the ISO file to the flash drive and check the hash of the copied ISO file with the original ISO file.</p>

		<h3># usb-creator -b -g -r</h3>
		<p>This will try to repair an unbootable flash drive that already contains ISO files.</p>
		
		<h3># usb-creator -h</h3>
		<p>This will show all available options and their usage.</p>

		<h2>Hidden features</h2>
		<p>When you remove the ISO file name from the ISO field, USB Creator will calculate the space needed for all ISO files in that directory.</p>
		<p>You can change the order in which the ISO files are displayed in the menu by adding a number in front of the ISO file name, e.g.: "01-MyDistro-amd64.iso".</p>
		<p>Symbolic links are followed but the symbolic links must have the ".iso" extension to make it work.</p>
		
		<h2>Your ISO is not booting?</h2>
		<p>On our <a href="https://github.com/SolydXK/usb-creator" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page you can see a list of tested distributions but not all can be booted directly from the ISO file. Check the distribution's forum if it can be booted directly from the ISO file.</p>
		<p>The menu is configured in a file which you can find on your flash drive: /boot/grub/grub.cfg</p>
		<p>Please help improve this application by adapting grub.cfg until the ISO boots and post your changes on GitHub or our <a href="http://forums.solydxk.com" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
		<p>Don't forget to attach the log file when you post an issue on our forum: /var/log/usb-creator.log</p>
